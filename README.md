# battleship
basic battleship game - a code I wrote as coursework while learning python through Codeacademy

The code executes and displays a gameboard and prompts player to guess where the battleship may be located.  Battleship location is generated with Random function.

If player guesses incorrectly within the board, output adjusts the board to show this guess with an X on the board along with a statement to notify player "You missed my battleship"

Should player guess numbers outside of the gameboard or non-integers, output will reflect with the statement "Oops, that's not even in the ocean"

If player guesses correctly within the allowed number of tries, they will be rewarded with the message notifying their victory on the battlefield "Congratulations! You've sunk my battleship"
